# Python Lesson Plans
Welcome to the <strong>Python Lesson Plans</strong> repository! This project is designed to offer structured learning materials for individuals<br> starting their journey with Python programming.

## Purpose
The aim of this repository is to provide a free, comprehensive, and progressively structured set of lesson plans for learning<br> Python. From absolute beginners to those looking to deepen their understanding, these lessons are crafted to guide you<br> through the language step by step.

## How to Use These Lesson Plans
1. <strong>Browse Lessons:</strong> Navigate through the `lessons/` folder where each lesson is stored. Lessons are organized sequentially.
2. <strong>Environment Setup:</strong> Start with the first lesson which will guide you through setting up your Python environment.
3. <strong>Learning Path:</strong>
   - <strong>Read:</strong> Go through the `*.md` files in each lesson folder for theory and explanations.
   - <strong>Code:</strong> Open the corresponding `*.py` files to see examples and write your own code.
   - <strong>Practice:</strong> Complete the exercises provided at the end of each lesson. Solutions can be found in `solutions/` if needed.
4. <strong>Projects:</strong> After completing the lessons, tackle the projects in the `projects/` folder to apply your knowledge.
5. <strong>Further Reading:</strong> Each lesson includes links to external resources for additional learning or clarification.

## Prerequisites
- No Prior Coding Experience Required: These lessons assume you are new to programming. However, a basic understanding of how computers work can be beneficial.
- Computer with Internet Access: For downloading Python, using online resources, and potentially using GitHub directly.
